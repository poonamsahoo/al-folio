    abstract = {Many people believe that it is disadvantageous for members aligning with a minority party to cluster in cities, as this makes it easier for the majority party to gerrymander district boundaries to diminish the representation of the minority. We examine this effect by exhaustively computing the average representation for every possible $5\times5$ grid of population placement and district boundaries. We show that, in fact, it is advantageous for the minority to arrange themselves in clusters, as it is positively correlated with representation. We extend this result to more general cases by considering the dual graph of districts, and we also propose and analyze metaheuristic algorithms that allow us to find strong lower bounds for maximum expected representation.},

    abstract = {We discuss properties of integers in base 3/2. We also introduce many new sequences related to base 3/2. Some sequences discuss patterns related to integers in base 3/2. Other sequence are analogues of famous base-10 sequences: we discuss powers of 3 and 2, Look-and-say, and sorted and reverse sorted Fibonaccis. The eventual behavior of sorted and reverse sorted Fibs leads to special Pinocchio and Oihcconip sequences respectively.},
